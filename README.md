# hastebin-python
A standalone Python program to handle HTTP POST requests to hastebin.app

# This project refers to hastebin.app, NOT hastebin.com - the first being a lightweight alternative of the latter!

**Installation**
This program must be run via a command line interface, and does not require specific installation.

**Use**
The program **currently** takes one argument, which is a filename within the same directory (though this will be updated in the future to allow for multiple files to be uploaded to Hastebin separately, or together, at the user's discretion).

You can upload a file like so:

`python Hastebin.py name_of_file.txt`

I've only tested text files, not other formats, so please do email or post any bugs on the Github.
